title: July 28, 2021 - Geometric bias in mouse brain networks from diffusion MRI
date: '2021-07-28T12:00:00.00Z'
description: 'My new manuscript uses graph theory and optical tracer imaging to show that many properties of structural mouse brain networks measured with diffusion MRI can be largely explained through their spatial embedding alone, revealing geometric biases in diffusion tractography.'
