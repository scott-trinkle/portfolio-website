title: August 1, 2021 - Manuscript figure chosen for cover of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine
date: '2021-08-01T12:00:00.00Z'
description: 'Our figure displaying spatial registration results between microCT and diffusion MRI orientation distribution functions is featured on the August 2021 cover.'

A figure from my manuscript "[Synchrotron X-ray micro-CT as a validation dataset
for diffusion MRI in whole mouse
brain](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.28776)" was selected to
be cover photo of the August 2021 issue of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.  The
figure displays spatial registration results between microCT and diffusion MRI
orientation distribution functions. For more info, read my [blog
post](/news/microct-papeer) about the project.

Twitter was excited at the news:
