I'm excited to announce that I have been hired to a full time position as a Data Engineer at [Waters
Corporation](https://www.waters.com/waters/en_US/Waters/nav.htm?cid=513691&locale=en_US).

My responsibilities involve the development of lightweight Python web apps that
use machine learning to create automated exploratory tools in the domain of
[mass spectrometry
imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry_imaging) (MSI) using
[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), with deployment through
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
