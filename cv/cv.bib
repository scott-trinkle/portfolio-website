abstract = {Mammalian neurons operate at length scales spanning six orders of magnitude; they project millimeters to centimeters across brain regions, are composed of micrometer-scale-diameter myelinated axons, and ultimately form nanometer scale synapses. Capturing these anatomical features across that breadth of scale has required imaging samples with multiple independent imaging modalities. Translating between the different modalities, however, requires imaging the same brain with each. Here, we imaged the same postmortem mouse brain over five orders of spatial resolution using MRI, whole brain micrometer-scale synchrotron x-ray tomography (μCT), and large volume automated serial electron microscopy. Using this pipeline, we can track individual myelinated axons previously relegated to axon bundles in diffusion tensor MRI or arbitrarily trace neurons and their processes brain-wide and identify individual synapses on them. This pipeline provides both an unprecedented look across a single brain's multi-scaled organization as well as a vehicle for studying the brain's multi-scale pathologies.}

abstract = {Purpose To introduce synchrotron X-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) and demonstrate its use as a natively isotropic, nondestructive, 3D validation modality for diffusion MRI in whole, fixed mouse brain. Methods Postmortem diffusion MRI and microCT data were acquired of the same whole mouse brain. Diffusion data were processed using constrained spherical deconvolution. Synchrotron data were acquired at an isotropic voxel size of 1.17 μm. Structure tensor analysis was used to calculate fiber orientation distribution functions from the microCT data. A pipeline was developed to spatially register the 2 datasets in order to perform qualitative comparisons of fiber geometries represented by fiber orientation distribution functions. Fiber orientations from both modalities were used to perform whole-brain deterministic tractography to demonstrate validation of long-range white matter pathways. Results Fiber orientation distribution functions were able to be extracted throughout the entire microCT dataset, with spatial registration to diffusion MRI simplified due to the whole brain extent of the microCT data. Fiber orientations and tract pathways showed good agreement between modalities. Conclusion Synchrotron microCT is a potentially valuable new tool for future multi-scale diffusion MRI validation studies, providing comparable value to optical histology validation methods while addressing some key limitations in data acquisition and ease of processing.},
